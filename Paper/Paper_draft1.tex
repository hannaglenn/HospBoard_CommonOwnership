    \section{Introduction}

    Several concerns arise when firms in direct competition share affiliated ownership. One example is common ownership, where investors hold substantial shares of firms in the same industry. While such investors do not actively manage the firms they own, they exert influence over firm behavior through voting rights and shareholder meetings. The common ownership hypothesis, first introduced by \citeauthor{rotemberg1984financial} (\citeyear{rotemberg1984financial}), posits that profit-maximizing firms place nonzero weight on the profits of competitors with shared owners. This raises antitrust concerns, as it may facilitate indirect collusion, affecting competition and prices. In this paper, I examine whether nonprofit firm behavior exhibits similar patterns of affiliation-driven influence.

    Unlike public firms, nonprofits do not have shareholders. Instead, they are guided by a board of directors: a group of volunteers responsible for selecting executives and holding them accountable. In some ways, a board functions similarly to shareholders, they influence the strategic direction of the organization without actively managing day-to-day operations. As with common ownership, there are no legal restrictions preventing directors from serving on multiple boards, even if those firms are competing. Therefore, if the firms are profit-maximizing, a parallel to the common ownership hypothesis arises. While previous studies have documented increased prices under common ownership in industries such as airlines and banking (\cite{azar2018anticompetitive}; \cite{azar2022ultimate}), no research has examined this phenomenon in the nonprofit sector. 
    
    The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, I document the extent of board-level affiliation among plausibly independent nonprofit hospitals, capturing a nonprofit equivalent to common ownership in a relevant US industry. Second, I explore the potential competitive effects of board affiliations on hospital behavior. The hospital industry provides an ideal setting for this study for three reasons. First, nonprofit hospitals play a dominant role in US health care. As of 2023, 50\% of hospitals were private nonprofits, compared to 36\% for-profit. Moreover, nonprofit hospitals operate larger facilities, with an average of 207 staffed beds, compared to 107 in for-profits (\cite{ASPE_2023}). Therefore, nonprofit hospital behavior directly impacts the patient population in the US. Second, nonprofit hospitals are often suspected of behaving like "for-profits in disguise" (\cite{nicholson2000measuring}; \cite{bai2021analysis}; \cite{bruch2021charity}), making them an appropriate context for testing the common ownership hypothesis, which relies on firms being profit-driven. Finally, hospital mergers and consolidations are under increasing scrutiny as competition in the sector has declined significantly in recent years (\cite{levinson2024ten}). 

    I compile information on hospital board of director teams from publicly available Tax Form 990s, filed each year by nonprofits in the US. One section of this form requires declaration of the names of each member of the board, executives, and highest compensated employees. Extracting these identities and matching to other sources of hospital information, I form a network of hospital board members from 2017-2022. I show that nearly 10\% of the nonprofit hospitals in the sample are affiliated with another hospital through shared board members, even excluding system or network affiliations. Two-thirds of affiliated pairs are made up of two general hospitals, with the remaining pairs consisting of a general hospital affiliated with a specialty hospital. 

    \section{Data}

    
   I compile data on nonprofit hospital board of directors from publicly available Tax Form 990s, which all sufficiently large nonprofits must file with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) each year. These forms contain a section in which firms declare their board, executives, and highest compensated employees. I limit to firms that have a completed Schedule H in the 990, indicating that the firm runs a hospital. PDF version of the 990s are made public by Nonprofit Explorer dating back earlier than 2009. However, using optical character recognition text extraction algorithms on these PDFs is both time consuming and can lead to small errors in names extracted. Thus, I analyze the data from 2017 onward, when the IRS began publishing XML versions of these files. Gathering information from the XML files ensures the name in the data matches the name that was filed.

   I extract all names and positions of individuals listed in the section titled ``Officers, Directors, Trustees, Key Employees, and Five Highest Compensated Employees". I also keep information on the filing firm: the Employee Identification Number (EIN), organization name and location, and other characteristics. There are 2,096 hospitals with information extracted directly from the XML files. 

   I use fuzzy string matching methods to match hospitals in the tax data to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Survey, which captures relevant hospital-level characteristics and outcomes. Specifically, I compute the Jaro-Winkler distance between hospital names in each data set. Then, I record matches with a sufficiently small distance and sufficiently similar address. Using this method, I have a sample of 1,623 hospitals in the tax data that can be linked to the AHA survey. 

    I clean the name column by removing common titles (Dr., Reverand, etc.), and combining names within the same firm that have slight spelling differences. For example, if John Matthews is a board member of hospital A in 2016, and John Mathews is a board member of hospital A in 2017, I assume these names represent the same person. Additionally, I combine names within the same HRR that are identical apart from small mis-characters such as the presence of a middle initial. Finally, to avoid issues in whether first or last names are listed first, I sort each individual's names alphabetically. I define a hospital as being affiliated if the same individual is a board member of two otherwise unaffiliated hospitals. That is, two hospitals that do not belong to the same system or network can be affiliated through board members, but sames-system or same-network hospital can not. I also focus on affiliations within the same hospital market, since the outcomes of interest capture changes in competitive behavior, which is most salient within the same market. I measure hospital markets using Hospital Referral Regions (HRRs) as defined by Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare using referral patterns of patient care. 

    ** i think i need to try the statistics with the control group being completely unaffiliated hospitals instead of those that are affiliated through system or network


    \section{Documenting Board of Director Affiliation}


    Of the approximately 1200 hospitals in the final sample, almost 10\% are affiliated with another hospital through a shared board member. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:connected_percent}, this percentage remains relatively constant over time, decreasing from 132 affiliated hospitals in 2017 to 117 affiliated hospitals in 2021. 

    \begin{figure}[ht!]

        \caption{Percent of hospitals that have a board affiliation}
        \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{Objects/connected_percent.pdf}
        \label{fig:connected_percent}
    \end{figure}

    As mentioned previously, common board members should be more likely to affect hospital behavior within a hospital market, where hospitals compete for the same patient population. Of the 306 HRRs in the US, approximately 17\% have at least one pair of affiliated hospitals within the market. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:connected_HRR_percent}, this proportion decreases slightly over time, with 15\% of HRRs having connected hospitals in 2021, a nominal decrease of 8 markets losing hospitals with affiliation.  


    \begin{figure}[ht!]

        \includegraphics[width=.8\textwidth]{Objects/connected_HRR_percent.pdf}
        \label{fig:connected_HRR_percent}
    \end{figure}

    The geographic distribution of these pairs is shown in Figure \ref{fig:connected_maps}, where the blue dots represent hospitals that share a common board member. Connected hospitals are distributed fairly regularly across the US, apart from relatively few connections on the west coast relative to the population. Over time, the connections remain fairly consistent geographically.

        \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{Objects/connected_maps.pdf}
        \label{fig:connected_maps}
    \end{figure}

    Finally, I show the proportion of the type of hospital pairs. Each hospital is general or specialty, children or adult, and independent or system. In Table \ref{tab:hospital_pair_types}, I show that the majority of pairs are both general hospitals, and that there is significant variation in the ownership type of pairs. Forty-five percent of pairs are between two non-system affiliated hospitals, and 36\% of pairs are between an independent hospital affiliated with a hospital belonging to a system.
